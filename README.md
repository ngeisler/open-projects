# open-projects
All open projects, designed and implemented by myself - to share ideas with others

## First big project i want to start with is a 2D RPG Game Editor.

It will be developed with java. The main interest is to write in test driven mode.
The goal is to learn more about this process and train myself to test more code in less time.
More information about the editor will follow at the project-folder in time.

## Second project was a shot-idea of a card game called MauMau.

It will be developed in java, but after first release it could be an app for android
or an other mobile platforms.
